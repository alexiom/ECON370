# Checklist

☑ R and RStudio are installed and running on your computer.

☑ Did anyone play around with `ggplot2`?

--

### Packages that you will need for today.

We're going to work almost exclusively in **base** R today.
- I'll also use the [**dplyr**](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) package, but only to demonstrate a few additional considerations for working with non-base libraries. Install/update it now, either through RStudio (recommended) or from your R console (`install.packages("dplyr"), dependencies = TRUE`). 
- (P.S. If you're on Linux, I recommend installing the pre-compiled binary version of **dplyr** from [RSPM](https://packagemanager.rstudio.com/client/#/repos/1/overview). This avoids the need to build the package from source, greatly reducing your installation time. See related example [here](https://twitter.com/grant_mcdermott/status/1263951531461603328).)

---

# Agenda

Today and the next lecture are going to be very hands on. 

- I'll have slides as per usual, but we're going to spent a lot of time live coding together.

This is deliberate. 

- I want you to get comfortable typing R commands yourself — and navigating the RStudio IDE — without resorting to copy+paste.
- Slightly more painful in the beginning, but much better payoff in the long-run.

(Some important R concepts)

# Basic Arithmetic

R is a powerful calculator and recognizes all of the standard arithmetic operators:


```r
1+2 ## Addition
```

```
## [1] 3
```

```r
6-7 ## Subtraction
```

```
## [1] -1
```

```r
5/2 ## Division
```

```
## [1] 2.5
```

```r
2^3 ## Exponentiation
```

```
## [1] 8
```

```r
2+4*1^3 ## Standard order of precedence (`*` before `+`, etc.)
```

```
## [1] 6
```

---

# Basic Arithmetic

When possible, do operators in vectors in `R`.


```r
first_vec = 1:5  #store our first vector
first_vec        #show vector
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3 4 5
```

```r
first_vec + 0.5  #add 1/2 to each element 
```

```
## [1] 1.5 2.5 3.5 4.5 5.5
```

```r
first_vec + 6:10 #add another vector to first_vector
```

```
## [1]  7  9 11 13 15
```

```r
first_vec + 6:9  #oops!
```

```
## Warning in first_vec + 6:9: longer object length is not a multiple of shorter
## object length
```

```
## [1]  7  9 11 13 11
```


---

# Basic Arithmetic (cont.)

We can also invoke modulo operators (quotient &amp; remainder). 
- Very useful when dealing with time, for example.


```r
100 %/% 60 ## How many whole hours in 100 minutes?
```

```
## [1] 1
```

```r
120 %/% 60 ## How many whole hours in 120 minutes?
```

```
## [1] 2
```

```r
100 %% 60 ## How many minutes are left over from dividing 100 by 60?
```

```
## [1] 40
```

```r
120 %% 60 ## How many minutes are left over from dividing 120 by 60?
```

```
## [1] 0
```

# Data Types

R has 6 basic data types:

1. Character
2. Numeric
3. Integer
4. Logical
5. Complex
6. Raw (we will mostly ignore this type)

---

# Data Types (cont.)

## Character

- The character type can be described as "text."
  - It is known as a "string" in other programming languages.


```r
my_name    = "Alex Marsh"
first_name = "Alex"
last_name  = "Marsh"     #good style to line up to equals signs
class(my_name)
```

```
## [1] "character"
```

```r
is.character(my_name)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

---

# Data Types (cont.)

## Character: Counting Characters


```r
length(my_name)
```

```
## [1] 1
```

```r
length(c(first_name,last_name))
```

```
## [1] 2
```

```r
nchar(my_name)
```

```
## [1] 10
```

```r
nchar(c(first_name,last_name))
```

```
## [1] 4 5
```

---

# Data Types (cont.)

## Character: Combinding Characters


```r
also_my_name = 'Alex Marsh'
my_name == also_my_name
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
paste(first_name,last_name)
```

```
## [1] "Alex Marsh"
```

```r
paste(first_name,last_name,sep="-")
```

```
## [1] "Alex-Marsh"
```

```r
paste0(first_name,last_name)
```

```
## [1] "AlexMarsh"
```

---

# Data Types (cont.)

## Character: An Aside

- The following code will look *very* similar to a user when examined in the console.


```r
my_name
```

```
## [1] "Alex Marsh"
```

```r
print(my_name)
```

```
## [1] "Alex Marsh"
```
--

- However, what's happening is ***very different.***
  - The first thing returns the *object* `my_name`
  - The second only prints the *contents* of the object `my_name`
--

- Imagine I have something written on a piece of paper. The first line is if I handed you the piece of paper and you read it. The second line is if I told you aloud what was written on the paper.
  - This difference will matter a lot when it comes to functions.

---

# Data Types (cont.)

## Character


```r
first_name + " " + last_name
```

```
## Error in first_name + " ": non-numeric argument to binary operator
```

```r
toupper(paste(first_name,last_name))
```

```
## [1] "ALEX MARSH"
```

```r
tolower(paste(first_name,last_name))
```

```
## [1] "alex marsh"
```

---

# Data Types (cont.)

## Character: Special Characters

- Special characters "not native" to English can still be used but must be encoded so that `R` handles them correctly. 
- Encoding guarantees that the computer will handle the special characters correctly.
- We will not spend much time on this; however, to read more about encoding text, [see this post.](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/utf8/vignettes/utf8.html)


---

# Data Types (cont.)

## Numeric

Numeric data are "numbers"
- In a lot of programming languages, there is this distinction between floats and integers. This is also true in `R` but to a much smaller degree. 
- Unless explicitly stated as an integer, all "numbers" are numeric data.

--


```r
my_age    = 28
my_height = 5 + 11/12
#my_height_apps = 6 + 0

c(my_age,my_height)
```

```
## [1] 28.000000  5.916667
```

```r
class(my_age)
```

```
## [1] "numeric"
```

```r
class(my_height)
```

```
## [1] "numeric"
```

---

# Data Types (cont.)

## Special Numeric Data

- There are a handful of special numeric values including Inf, -Inf and NaN
- Be careful when working with these

--


```r
1/0
```

```
## [1] Inf
```

```r
log(0)
```

```
## [1] -Inf
```

```r
log(-1)
```

```
## Warning in log(-1): NaNs produced
```

```
## [1] NaN
```

---


# Data Types (cont.)

## Integers

"Whole numbers"
- Integers in R are distinguished from numeric data by having an L after the number part.
- The distinction between numeric and integers is not that important here in R.
  - We will mostly ignore the distinction.

--


```r
also_my_age = 28L
class(my_age)
```

```
## [1] "numeric"
```

```r
class(also_my_age)
```

```
## [1] "integer"
```

---

# Data Types (cont.)

## Logical

Logical data are either `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
- `T` and `F` are equivalent.

--


```r
R_is_fun  = TRUE
R_is_hard = FALSE
true      = T
false     = F

R_is_fun  == true
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
R_is_hard == false
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

---

# Data Types (cont.)

## Logical: Operations

The most common use of logical data is for testing conditions and control flow.
- \&gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, and &lt;= test for greater/less than and/or equal to.
- &amp; and | are the logical operators for "and" and "or" respectively.
  - Order of operations: &amp; are evaluated before |.
- ! negates a logical: `!TRUE` becomes `FALSE` and vice versa,
- To test if equal, use two equal signs ==. Not equal !=.

```r
2 &gt; 1
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
1 &gt; 2 &amp; 1 &gt; 1/2
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```

```r
1 &gt; 2 | 1 &gt; 1/2
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
2 &gt; 1 | 1 &gt; 1/2
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

---

# Data Types (cont.)

## Logical: Operations

--


```r
1 &gt; 1/2 &amp; 1 &gt; 2 | 3 &gt; 2   #order of operations are important
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
1 &gt; 2 &amp; (1 &gt; 1/2 | 3 &gt; 2) #use parenthesis when in doubt
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```

```r
0.5 == 1/2
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
3   != 2                  #that is ! followed by a =
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

---
# Data Types (cont.)

## Logical: Operations

%in% tests for containment

--


```r
R_is_fun
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
!R_is_fun
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```

```r
2 %in% c(1,2,3,4)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
!(5 %in% c(1,2,3,4))
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```
---
# Aside: Binary operators

Operators like +, -, /, %%, %in%, etc are special functions in R that are binary operators.
--

Notice that above to do "not in," it was a bit clunky:

```r
!(5 %in% c(1,2,3,4))
```

--
You can define a new binary operator like so:

```r
"%!in%" = function(a,b){!(a %in% b)}
5 %!in% c(1,2,3,4)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```
---
# Data Types (cont.)

## Special Logicals

- `NA` is a special type of logical data 
- Cannot be compared the same way.
- `NA` is different than `NaN`

--


```r
NA == TRUE
```

```
## [1] NA
```

```r
is.na(NA)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
1 == NaN
```

```
## [1] NA
```

```r
is.nan(NA)
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```

---

# Data Types (cont.)

## Logical: Operations

If "mathematical operations" are performed on logicals, they will be coerced into 1s and 0s. 

--


```r
as.numeric(c(TRUE,FALSE))
```

```
## [1] 1 0
```

```r
TRUE + FALSE
```

```
## [1] 1
```

```r
sum(c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE))
```

```
## [1] 2
```

```r
mean(c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE))
```

```
## [1] 0.6666667
```
---

# Data Types (cont.)

## Logical: Comparing Floats

Must be careful when testing for equality of floating point numbers ("decimals")

--


```r
0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```

What happened?
--

- Finite precision: floating point numbers aren't exact due to how numbers are stored in a computer.


```r
all.equal(0.1+0.2,0.3)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

---
# Data Types (cont.)

## Logical

You can read more about logical operators and types &lt;a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Logic.html" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/logical.html" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

---
# Data Types (cont.)

## Complex

Complex data are data that have complex numbers.
- We probably won't use these much but can pop-up if you're not careful.


```r
2+3*sqrt(-1) #doesn't work
```

```
## Warning in sqrt(-1): NaNs produced
```

```
## [1] NaN
```

```r
2+3i         #works
```

```
## [1] 2+3i
```

```r
class(2+3i)  #complex
```

```
## [1] "complex"
```


---

# Assignment

In `R`, we can use either `&lt;-` or `=` to handle assignment.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

.footnote[
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The `&lt;-` is really a `&lt;` followed by a `-`. It just looks like one thing b/c of the [font](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) I'm using here.
]

--

### Assignment with `&lt;-`

`&lt;-` is normally read aloud as "gets". You can think of it as a (left-facing) arrow saying *assign in this direction*.


```r
a &lt;- 10 + 5
a
```

```
## [1] 15
```

--

Of course, an arrow can point in the other direction too (i.e. `-&gt;`). So, the following code chunk is equivalent to the previous one, although used much less frequently.

```r
10 + 5 -&gt; a
```

---

# Assignment (cont.)

### Assignment with `=`

You can also use `=` for assignment.


```r
b = 10 + 10 ## Note that the assigned object *must* be on the left with "=".
b
```

```
## [1] 20
```

--

### Which assignment operator to use?

Most R users (purists?) seem to prefer `&lt;-` for assignment, since `=` also has specific role for evaluation *within* functions. 
- We'll see lots of examples of this later.
- But I don't think it matters; `=` is quicker to type and is more intuitive if you're coming from another programming language. (More discussion [here](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/issues/319#issuecomment-427376764) and [here](https://www.separatinghyperplanes.com/2018/02/why-you-should-use-and-never.html).)
- I prefer `=` as it makes for easier to read and cleaner code.

**Bottom line:** Use whichever you prefer. Just be consistent.

# Data Structures

In base `R`, there are 5 main data structures (not exhaustive).

1. atomic vector
2. list
3. matrix/array
4. data.frame
5. factors

---
# Data Structures (cont.)

## Vectors

- Vectors are a collection of multiple objects.
- There are two types of vectors:
  1. atomic vectors
  2. lists.
- Atomic vectors must be all of the same type of data.
- To create an atomic vector, put multiple objects within `c()` separated by commas.
  - **Never store an object as c!** 
  - Will break your code and it might take hours to figure out why.
- A list is a collection of atomic vectors.
- Atomic vectors are one dimensional

--


```r
numeric_grades = c(90,75,95,85,100,60,76)
letter_grades  = c("A-","C","A","B","A","D","C")
mixed_grades   = c("A", 95,"B",85,"C",75)
```

--

I said atomic vectors must be all of the same type. However, the last line ran without an error. What do you think happened?

---
# Data Structures (cont.)

```

```r

```

```
## [1] "character"
```
---
# Data Structures (cont.)

## Vectors: Attributes

- Objects in R can have attributes. Each type of data structure (and objects more generally) will have different attributes.
- Types of attributes include (but not limited to):
 1. names
 2. dimnames
 3. class

---

# Data Structures (cont.)

## Vectors: Indexing
- Indexing in `R` is very simple: it starts at 1 and count up by 1.
  - This is different than indexing in other programming languages which starts at 0.
  - Most "mathematical" languages will start at 1 e.g. `R`, `Matlab`, `Julia`.
- To index a vector, put `[i]` after the name of the vector where `i` is the ith position.


```r
some_numbers = c(27,22,94)
some_numbers[1]
```

```
## [1] 27
```

```r
some_numbers[3]
```

```
## [1] 94
```

```r
some_numbers[1:2]
```

```
## [1] 27 22
```

---

# Data Structures (cont.)

## Vectors: Indexing
- Can use indexing to change values in an object   

--


```r
some_numbers[2]
```

```
## [1] 22
```

```r
some_numbers[2] = 23
some_numbers[2]
```

```
## [1] 23
```

--

- Can sequentially index

--


```r
some_numbers[1:2][2]
```

```
## [1] 23
```

---
# Data Structures (cont.)

## Lists

- Lists are collections of atomic vectors.
- Since each atomic vector is still an atomic vector, within vector types have to be the same but across vectors can differ in type.

--


```r
names(letter_grades) = paste("Student",1:length(letter_grades))
grade_list = list(names(numeric_grades),numeric_grades,letter_grades)
grade_list
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] "Student 1" "Student 2" "Student 3" "Student 4" "Student 5" "Student 6"
## [7] "Student 7"
## 
## [[2]]
## Student 1 Student 2 Student 3 Student 4 Student 5 Student 6 Student 7 
##        90        75        95        85       100        60        76 
## 
## [[3]]
## Student 1 Student 2 Student 3 Student 4 Student 5 Student 6 Student 7 
##      "A-"       "C"       "A"       "B"       "A"       "D"       "C"
```

---

# Data Structures (cont.)

## Lists: Indexing
- Indexing for lists is almost the same as vectors, you just have another layer to deal with.
- To return an element of the list as a list, use single brackets: `[i]`
- To return an element of the list as a vector, use double brackets: `[[i]]`

--


```r
grade_list[1]
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] "Student 1" "Student 2" "Student 3" "Student 4" "Student 5" "Student 6"
## [7] "Student 7"
```

```r
grade_list[[1]]
```

```
## [1] "Student 1" "Student 2" "Student 3" "Student 4" "Student 5" "Student 6"
## [7] "Student 7"
```

---
# Data Structures (cont.)

## Lists: Indexing
- Elements of a list can still have names

--

## Lists: Indexing
- You can access an element of a list using it's name and the `$`

--


```r
grade_list$`numeric grade` #`` are used because of the space
```

```
## Student 1 Student 2 Student 3 Student 4 Student 5 Student 6 Student 7 
##        90        75        95        85       100        60        76
```

--

- Double indexing still works

--


```r
grade_list[[1]][4]
```

```
## [1] "Student 4"
```

```r
grade_list$`student names`[4]
```

```
## [1] "Student 4"
```

## Matrix

- Matrices are essentially two dimensional atomic vectors.
- Most things that apply to atomic vectors are true for matrices
- While we can make character matrices, they aren't very useful as matrices are most useful for mathematical operations.
- Due to the nature of this course, we will probably not use matrices much as we are not coding things by hand.

--

```r
num_mat = matrix(1:9,ncol=3)
num_mat
```

```
##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
## [1,]    1    4    7
## [2,]    2    5    8
## [3,]    3    6    9
```

---
# Data Structures (cont.)

## Matrix: Indexing
- Indexing a matrix is similar to atomic vectors; two dimensions to index.
- If one dimension is omitted, returns that entire dimension.
- First index is for rows; second index is for columns.


```r
num_mat[1,2]
```

```
## [1] 4
```

```r
num_mat[1,]
```

```
## [1] 1 4 7
```

```r
num_mat[,2]
```

```
## [1] 4 5 6
```

```r
num_mat[5]
```

```
## [1] 5
```

# Data Structures (cont.)

## Array

- Arrays are 2 dimensional *or greater* matrices.
- Again, while arrays can be useful, we will likely not be working with them much.


```r
num_array = array(1:(3*3*2),dim = c(3,3,2))
num_array
```

```
## , , 1
## 
##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
## [1,]    1    4    7
## [2,]    2    5    8
## [3,]    3    6    9
## 
## , , 2
## 
##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
## [1,]   10   13   16
## [2,]   11   14   17
## [3,]   12   15   18
```

---
# Data Structures (cont.)

## Array: Indexing

- Indexing is same as matrices, just the same number of indexes as dimensions
--


```r
num_array[1,2,1]
```

```
## [1] 4
```

```r
num_array[,,1]
```

```
##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
## [1,]    1    4    7
## [2,]    2    5    8
## [3,]    3    6    9
```

```r
num_array[1,2,]
```

```
## [1]  4 13
```

```r
num_array[12]
```

```
## [1] 12
```

## Data.frame

- data.frames are basically "data sets."
- Using established terminology, they are collections of atomic vectors in a rectangular format.
  - This may sound similar to lists; however, lists don't have a restriction on the geometric format.
    - Could have a lists of lists of lists etc.
- Each column of a data.frame must be of the same type.
- Each row is an observation.


```r
data(mtcars)
head(mtcars,5)
```

```

# Data Structures (cont.)

## Data.frame

- `names()` on a data.frame returns the names of the variables.
- `length()` and `ncol()` return the number of variables in the data.frame
- `nrow()` returns the number of rows in the data.frame.
- Note: if you don't use `head()`, `tail()` or another way to restrict which rows are returned, returning a data.frame will return all rows, which is annoying.
 - This is fixed in a popular library called `data.table` that we will learn later.

## Data.frame: Indexing
- Indexing a data.frame is similar to indexing a matrix; the columns can have names


```r
mtcars[1:5,"mpg"]
```

```
## [1] 21.0 21.0 22.8 21.4 18.7
```

```r
mtcars$mpg[1:5]
```

```
## [1] 21.0 21.0 22.8 21.4 18.7
```

```r
mtcars[1:5,1]
```

```
## [1] 21.0 21.0 22.8 21.4 18.7
```

```r
row.names(mtcars)[1:5]
```

```
## [1] "Mazda RX4"         "Mazda RX4 Wag"     "Datsun 710"       
## [4] "Hornet 4 Drive"    "Hornet Sportabout"

# Data Structures (cont.)

## Factors:

- Factors are essentially categorical variables.
- Factors can organized text into different groups.
- Are only really useful to data analysis and modeling.
- Factors have different "levels" which are the groups.
- Can be tricky when first learning, but ultimately rather simple.


```r
fact_groups = letters[sample(1:26,10,replace=T)]
fact_groups
```

```
##  [1] "a" "j" "z" "y" "w" "f" "m" "g" "n" "j"
```

```r
fact_groups = factor(fact_groups,levels=letters)
fact_groups
```

```
##  [1] a j z y w f m g n j
## Levels: a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
```

# Help

For more information on a (named) function or object in R, consult the "help" documentation. For example:

```R
help(plot)
```

Or, more simply, just use `?`:
  
```R
# This is what most people use.
?plot 
```

--

&lt;/br&gt;

**Aside 1:** Comments in R are demarcated by `#`. 
- Hit `Ctrl+Shift+c` in RStudio to (un)comment whole sections of highlighted code.

--

**Aside 2:** See the *Examples* section at the bottom of the help file?
- You can run them with the `example()` function. Try it: `example(plot)`.

### Vignettes

For many packages, you can also try the `vignette()` function, which will provide an introduction to a package and it's purpose through a series of helpful examples.
- Try running `vignette("dplyr")` in your console now.

--

I highly encourage reading package vignettes if they are available. 
- They are often the best way to learn how to use a package.

--

One complication is that you need to know the exact name of the package vignette(s).
- E.g. The `dplyr` package actually has several vignettes associated with it: "dplyr", "window-functions", "programming", etc.
- You can run `vignette()` (i.e. without any arguments) to list the available vignettes of every *installed* package installed on your system. 
- Or, run `vignette(all = FALSE)` if you only want to see the vignettes of any *loaded* packages.

---

# Help (cont.)

### Demos

Similar to vignettes, many packages come with built-in, interactive demos.

To list all available demos on your system:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; 

```r
demo(package = .packages(all.available = TRUE))
```

.footnote[
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; How would you limit the demos to one particular package?
]

--

To run a specific demo, just tell R which one and the name of the parent package. For example:

```r
demo("graphics", package = "graphics")
```
